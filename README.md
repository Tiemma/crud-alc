# CRUD Application

This was built as part of the challenge posed by the Andela Learning community to get certification as part of a Udacity course training on  Web Applications.

This web application is a SPA(Single Page Application) which fetches  and stores data from a remote mongoDB database.

This crud application that implements the following stack:

### Backend
> MongoDB

> Node

> GraphQL

I opted in for GraphQL as it had easier route configuration and better data consumption from API's due to its feature to send data from multiple collections without unncessary aggregations.


## Frontend
> Materialize CSS

This was a simple demo so I just used a CSS framework to ease development.


## Running the application

You can run the web application by first installing all the necessary dependencies

> npm install

From there :

> npm start

The application sets up a graphql server by default and is available on port 3000
